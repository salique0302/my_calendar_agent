## 🧠 What Will You Learn During This Project?

This project offers a rich, hands-on learning experience across several key areas in AI, API integration, and full-stack development. Here’s a breakdown of the skills and concepts you'll master:

---

### 🧠 1. LangChain & LLM Agents
- Learn how to **build AI assistants** using **LangChain** tools and agents.
- Understand how to **route user queries** to appropriate tools using `tool-calling` logic.
- Grasp the concept of **memory, context, and prompt chaining** in LLM-based workflows.

---

### 🔐 2. User Authentication & Session Management
- Implement **secure login and registration** using `bcrypt` and `Streamlit Authenticator`.
- Handle **Streamlit session state** for token persistence and user tracking.
- Practice good **security hygiene** (e.g., hiding secrets, password hashing).

---

### 📅 3. Google Calendar API + OAuth2
- Learn how to authenticate users via **OAuth 2.0** and manage **access/refresh tokens**.
- Practice **event creation**, **listing**, and **deletion** via **Google Calendar API**.
- Handle edge cases like token expiration and reauthorization.

---

### 💬 4. Natural Language Query Handling
- Discover how to **convert plain English inputs into calendar actions** using LLMs.
- Work with **structured outputs (function calling)** from models like Gemini Pro.
- Handle ambiguous queries gracefully using fallback logic.

---

### 🧩 5. Full Stack AI App using Streamlit
- Build a modern, **responsive UI** using **Streamlit**.
- Integrate frontend and backend logic seamlessly.
- Use **modular code organization** across multiple files for scalability.

---

### ⚙️ 6. Deployment Readiness & Best Practices
- Organize a project with production in mind: separation of config, auth, tools, etc.
- Prepare `.gitignore`, secret key management, and API credentials securely.
- Optionally deploy on platforms like **Streamlit Cloud** or **Render**.

---

### 🎯 Bonus Learning Outcomes
- Real-world experience of building something similar to **AI calendar assistants** used in Google Workspace and Microsoft Copilot.
- Exposure to cutting-edge tools and APIs that are in demand in AI-driven startups.

---

#### 🚀 By completing this project, you’ll have built an **end-to-end, AI-powered productivity tool** — something highly impressive for your GitHub portfolio, interviews, or hackathons.
