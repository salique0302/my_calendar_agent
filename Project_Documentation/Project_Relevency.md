## 📌 Why This Project is Relevant for My Portfolio

This project, **Calendar AI Assistant**, showcases my ability to build a real-world, AI-powered productivity tool that combines:

- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing** (via LangChain + Gemini Pro)
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication Systems** (bcrypt + Streamlit Authenticator)
- 📅 **Third-party API Integration** (Google Calendar API with OAuth2)
- 🛠️ **Tool Orchestration** (LangChain tools for event creation, listing, and more)
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Development using Python and Streamlit**

### 👨‍💻 What It Demonstrates

| Skill                      | How It's Shown in the Project                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI + LLM Integration       | Seamless use of Gemini (Generative AI) via LangChain                   |
| Authentication & Security  | Custom login/registration with password hashing using bcrypt           |
